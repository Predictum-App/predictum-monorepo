2. You should chose void, if you cannot find answer of the question, which can be expressed by the outcome names.
3. You should always consider the date when the question was asked. E.g the question is "Will ETH hit 4000$ by the end of August 7" and the question was asked on August 6-th, your answer should not be Yes if ETH has hit 4000$ before, but not in that time window. The same logic applies for all questions.

    </predictionMarketOutcomes>
8. The date asked will be provided in this markup <predictionMarketDateAsked></predictionMarketDateAsked>
